As mentioned in the documentation, links to the playground can be
included in any document (slides, manual, book, web site, article,
spreadsheet, etc.) provided the tool used for editing allows including
URLs. This includes google docs, Jupyter notebooks, and also Word,
LaTeX, web site generators, etc., etc. This directory contains
some examples of how to embed calls to the playground in documents.
